This folder contains the Arduino code to turn on the FANs and LEDs on certain environmental conditions.

The LEDs will turn on when there is very low light in your room, in order to make ambient lighting
The FANs will turn on when the temperature of the thermistor (I put it between the fins of the AtomicPi heatsink) is above 35 Celsius.
