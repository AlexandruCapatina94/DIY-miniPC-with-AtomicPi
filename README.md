This repository includes the 3d models, code, list of components and pictures in order to build a miniPC with the AtomicPi SBC.

List of components used by me:

- AtomicPi

- MeanWell PSU (5V and 12V), dimensions: 127 * 76 * 42mm (L * W * H)

- 3D modelled case which I laser-cut from 2.5mm MDF

- the drive from a 1TB WD my Passport (2.5" drive)

- 2 x 80mm silent fans

- USB3 dongle for additional ports

- mini OLED screen

- temperature sensor, light sensor

- 12V LED strip

- Arduino Nano for controlling the OLED screen, LEDs and measure temperature and light

- transistors, rezistors etc.

- DIY USB mod for the camera port

- DIY connector to power the AtomicPi
