This folder contains all the STL files if you want to print the case along with the spacers for the
AtomicPi and the PSU and the fixtures for the walls.

Please bare in mind that if you use the same fans as I did, you will need to modify the 2 fixtures that
go in the top front corners because there is not enough space. I used some sandpaper to trim them.
